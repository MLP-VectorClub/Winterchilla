Your e-mail address ({{ email }}) was added to an account on our website. We're sending this e-mail to confirm the address belongs to whoever did this.

If you own this address and requested this change yourself then please use the link below to update the address in your account:

{% include 'email/text/_button.txt.twig' with { url: verify_url, text: 'Verify my e-mail address' } %}

If this was in fact not done by you you can safely ignore this email. In case you are being spammed with messages from us you can click the link below to stop receiving unwanted verification e-mails from our website permanently.

{% include 'email/text/_button.txt.twig' with { url: block_url, text: 'Block future emails' } %}

Both of the links above will expire on {{ expires_at | date('Y-m-d g:i:s a') }} at {{ expires_at | date('g:i:s a T') }}, after which you will need to manually resend this confirmation message through the site.
